A class in C++ is a user defined data type.
C++ classes can have functions as well as data
functions in classes are also called methods
We want the access functions to be public
So we add the keyword "public" and all members listed after it are accessible
The nice thing about C++ classes, the default is to make all members private. 
This means only other members of the class can access the data.
We can use functions to access the data in a class.

Get functions return the data, so get functions use  the variable type of the returned data when being declared
For example: To access the data called name, the function declaration would be:

We would like to have the information associated with each student. So let's say our Student data type has:
Functions that access and/or modify data values in classes are called mutators. 
 * a name
 * an id number
 * a graduation date
 * These three are members of Student.

The syntax for a class is:

        class ClassName
        {
            member1;
            member2;
            ...

        public:
            return variable accessFunction1(function parameters);
            return variable accessFunction2(function parameters); 
            ...
        } ;

        returnVariable ClassName:: accessFunction1(function parameters)
        {
            function statements;
        }

        returnVariable ClassName:: accessFunction2(function parameters)
        {
            function statements;
        }

As an aside, some conventions list the public definitions first, including the Google C++ Style Guide. 
It is best to use the convention used by the company paying you to code.
